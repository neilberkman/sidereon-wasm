## Reference algorithms (no code copied)

The following informed reimplementations from public specifications/literature;
no source code was copied:

- SGP4 / SDP4: D. Vallado et al., "Revisiting Spacetrack Report #3" (AIAA), and
  the CelesTrak reference vectors (validation only).
- Frame/time-scale conventions cross-checked against Skyfield (MIT) and the IAU
  conventions.
- Galileo NeQuick-G: reimplemented from the Galileo OS SIS ICD "Ionospheric
  Correction Algorithm for Galileo Single Frequency Users"; MODIP and CCIR data
  tables transcribed as ITU-R / EU-JRC reference data (facts).
- NRLMSISE-00: U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (public domain).
