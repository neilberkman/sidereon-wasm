//! Solid-earth tide station displacement (IERS Conventions, Chapter 7).
//!
//! [`solid_earth_tide`] computes the tidal displacement of an Earth-fixed (ITRF)
//! GNSS station caused by the lunar and solar gravitational attraction. It is a
//! derived work of the IERS Conventions (2010) reference routine
//! `DEHANTTIDEINEL.F` (and its companion routines `ST1IDIU`, `ST1ISEM`,
//! `ST1L1`, `STEP2DIU`, `STEP2LON`, `CAL2JD`, `DAT`), reproduced here in Rust.
//!
//! How this derived work is based upon and differs from the original Software:
//!
//! * It is a line-for-line Rust translation of the in-phase degree-2/degree-3
//!   displacement, the out-of-phase corrections (`ST1IDIU`, `ST1ISEM`), the
//!   latitude-dependence correction (`ST1L1`), and the frequency-dependent
//!   step-2 diurnal/long-period band corrections (`STEP2DIU`, `STEP2LON`),
//!   evaluating the identical Love/Shida numbers, long-period table and
//!   leap-second table.
//! * Its diurnal (Step 2) table has two variants, [`StationTideConstants`].
//!   [`StationTideConstants::IersRoutine`] is the routine's `DATDI` array as
//!   distributed. [`StationTideConstants::Conventions`], the default, corrects
//!   three rows of it to the Conventions text and the physics it states:
//!   - K1 out-of-phase radial amplitude -0.78 mm, as Table 7.3a prints it in
//!     the 2010 edition and in the chapter update of 1 February 2018, and as
//!     Equation (7.12c) gives it from the K1 row of Table 7.2 (h(0)I = 0.0030
//!     against the nominal hI = -0.0025, with the Cartwright-Tayler-Edden
//!     amplitude Hf = 0.368645 m of the IERS routine `ADMINT.F`: -0.783 mm).
//!     The routine (revision of 19 December 2016) and RTKLIB use -0.80 mm.
//!   - P1 out-of-phase radial amplitude +0.07 mm. Table 7.3a and the routine
//!     both have -0.07 mm, but Equation (7.12c) with Table 7.2 (P1
//!     h(0)I = -0.0011, Hf = -0.121995 m) gives +0.066 mm; the sign error was
//!     identified by H. Krásná and is corrected in Orekit's copy of Table 7.3a.
//!   - The 25th row is tide 166,564 (s multiplier 1), the tide Tables 6.5a and
//!     7.2 list between psi1 and 167,355; the routine's s multiplier 0 names
//!     156,564, out of the table's frequency order and in no Conventions table.
//!
//!   The Conventions' version notes (v1.0.0 to v1.3.0) list no correction to
//!   either source. The two variants differ by at most the sum of the three
//!   changes, 0.02 + 0.14 + 0.02 mm, in the displacement.
//! * It applies the permanent part of the displacement: the routine's
//!   commented-out "Step 3" permanent-tide removal stays out, so coordinates
//!   corrected with it are "conventional tide free", the system of the ITRF
//!   (IERS Conventions (2010), Section 7.1.1.2).
//! * The routine names are changed from the IERS originals (per the IERS
//!   Conventions Software License), and the Fortran subroutine structure is
//!   inlined into private helpers.
//! * The bundled IERS routine incorporates the SOFA `CAL2JD` and `DAT`
//!   companion routines. Their Rust translations are likewise private and
//!   renamed, while retaining SOFA-compatible numerical behavior.
//!
//! The Sun and Moon geocentric positions are inputs (metres, ECEF/ITRF); the
//! caller supplies them, e.g. from [`crate::astro::bodies::sun_moon_ecef`].
